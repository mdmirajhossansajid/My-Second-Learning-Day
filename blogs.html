            <h4>How to Get There </h4>
            <p>Take a bus from Srimangal to Ham Ham Waterfall.Hum Hum Waterfall (also called Ham Ham) in Bangladesh's Moulvibazar District is a popular, challenging trekking
            destination known for its beauty and adventure, located deep in the Razkandi forest near the Indian border. Visitors
            must trek through dense jungle, crossing streams and hills, often taking 2-4 hours each way, requiring proper gear,
            guides, and planning due to remote conditions, with the rainy season offering peak water flow but higher risk from
            leeches and slippery terrain</p>

            <h4>Best Time to Visit</h4>
            <p>The best time to visit Ham Ham Waterfall is during the dry season from November to April when the weather is pleasant and the trekking conditions are safer. Avoid the monsoon season (June to September) due to heavy rains, slippery trails, and increased leech activity.</p>
